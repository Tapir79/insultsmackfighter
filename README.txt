To run the project from the command line, go to the dist folder and
type the following:

java -jar "InsultSmackFighter.jar" 


This project is far from complete and is just a part of a game engine I started to build this spring. 
If you are new to this and  want to learn how to animate sprites feel free to look at the source code 
(and probably re-program it better yourself). Linus Torvald is not yet animated. Bill Gates is. 

The characters don't do anything but move back and forth and stop if there's a screen collision. 
Feel free to try the (very simple) demo out. :)
